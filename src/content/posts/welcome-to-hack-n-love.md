# Welcome to Hack n Love! üéâ

We're excited to launch our new blog built with the amazing [multiterm-astro](https://github.com/stelcodes/multiterm-astro) theme! This terminal-inspired blog will be our home for sharing programming tutorials, development insights, and tech discussions.

## What to Expect

Here's what you can look forward to on this blog:

### Programming Tutorials
We'll share step-by-step guides covering various technologies and frameworks. From beginner-friendly introductions to advanced techniques.

### Development Tips
Best practices, productivity tips, and lessons learned from our coding adventures.

### Tech Insights
Our thoughts on the latest trends, tools, and technologies in the software development world.

## Terminal-Inspired Design

We chose this theme because we love the terminal aesthetic - it reflects our developer mindset and creates a focused reading experience. The theme supports:

- Multiple color schemes (59 themes to choose from!)
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Dark/light mode support
- Clean, distraction-free reading

```javascript
// Sample code block to test syntax highlighting
function welcome() {
  console.log("Welcome to Hack n Love!");
  console.log("Happy coding! üöÄ");
}

welcome();
```
